I am Chris, I'm 26 my passions include IT, classic cars and gaming, I got into IT because I have always had a fascination about how things computers, webpages and applications work, My main interest in IT is to eventually work up to doing a Bachelor's in IT majoring in Networking and Cybersecurity. I came to RMIT through OUA to do the prerequisite courses for the Bachelor's degree I aim to do. I hope to learn the necessary fundamentals to build on that knowledge and be successful in my future courses and career.</p>

									<h4>Project Idea</h4>		
									<p>I would like to create an educational drag and drop style app with text-to-speech and audible feedback for children to develop tactile and audible skills then moving to more advanced levels of learning as they complete the basic levels with competence, I believe this is important because a lot of children are drawn to fun apps and games that do little or nothing to help them develop psychologically. My fiancee works in child care and is always looking for new ideas and tools to integrate into her teaching plans. There is a huge lack of applications that actually achieve a good end result in teaching as most are made to engage the child with flashes and short sounds to attract kids to the app but not actually take in what they are supposed to be learning.
									
									<br />
									I will need to learn a lot more Java as I intend to create this project for Android devices and I will need to have other andoid devides to be able to test on different devices with different specifications, though I believe I can use emulation to bypass a lot of the cost that would be involved in that.
									<br />
									
									If successful I would hope that I can build upon the app to create a better and more long lasting learning style for children to learn as they grow, with harder tasks to achieve as they grow they will continue to learn and hopefully be able to apply the knowlege gained into their classes and ultimately their future outside of class/school.</p>
